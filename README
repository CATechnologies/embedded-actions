The "embeded_actions" plugin 
============================

Just like the traditional render :partial, embeded actions allow you to refactor
your views and extract presentation logic and templates into separate files.

Unlike partials, embeded actions also let you define business logic to be
performed before the partial is included. That logic is encapsulated in the
already well understood metaphor of an action inside a controller.

So a simple call like

<%= render_embeded :controller => "songs", :action => "top10" %>

lets you include an html fragment containing the top 10 songs into any of your
pages, regardless of which controller, action or view wants to do the including.

Additionally, embeded actions can provide caching of their results (allowing for
different parameters) just like page caching, but at the level of html
fragments. So your dynamic pages can still be rendered dynamically, but some
embeded action can be cached with different expiration policies.
